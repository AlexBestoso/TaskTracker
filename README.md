# BestosoTaskTracker

One day, Bestoso got bored and decided to build this because he was sick of keeping track of tasks using notepad++

Requirements : MSSQL Database

Starting : Run the EXE. The terminal will prompt for mssql user and password (password is masked). 
            if the database doesn't exist, it will be created. The same goes for any tables that are supposed to be there. 
            

Usage : After logging in, enter 0 to start managing tasks, 1 to try to connect to the database, 2 to exit the program. 
        
Managing Tasks : To manage your tasks, type 0 and press enter while in the main menu. For a list of commands, type `help`

You can figure out the rest. Stop being lazy.
